My heart is true

If my heart is true
Say "Hello"

If my heart aint wrong
Whisper "Let's spend some time together"

("My age is 64" results in my age = 2 because of string poetic literals)
(it is according to spec though)

Put 64 into my age
Put 16 into your age
If my age is your age
Shout "We'd get bored"

If your age is 16
Shout "Sweet Sixteen"

My age is "old"
Your age is "young"

If my age is your age
Shout "We'd get bored"

If your age is "young"
Shout "Sweet Sixteen"

While my heart is true
Whisper "I love you"
Put wrong into my heart

Say "Goodbye"
